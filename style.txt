Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a psycho-social intervention that aims to improve mental health. CBT focuses on challenging and changing unhelpful cognitive distortions and behaviors, improving emotional regulation, and developing personal coping strategies that target solving current problems.

Originally developed to treat depression, CBT is now used for a variety of mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders, alcohol and drug use problems, marital problems, eating disorders, and severe mental illness. It is typically short-term and goal-oriented, involving collaboration between therapist and client.

CBT is based on the concept that your thoughts, feelings, and actions are interconnected, and that negative thoughts and feelings can trap you in a vicious cycle. It helps you deal with overwhelming problems in a more positive way by breaking them down into smaller parts.

A key part of CBT is helping patients identify and challenge distorted thinking patterns, such as all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, catastrophizing, and personalization. Therapists often use techniques like journaling, behavioral experiments, exposure therapy, and cognitive restructuring.

CBT sessions are structured, with each session having a clear agenda and goals. Patients may be assigned homework tasks to reinforce learning. Progress is tracked over time, and the goal is to equip patients with self-help tools they can use in daily life.

CBT has been extensively researched and is considered one of the most effective treatments for various psychological disorders. It is endorsed by national health institutions and often used as a first-line treatment.

While effective, CBT may not be suitable for everyone. Some individuals might find the structure too rigid or struggle to engage with the process. In such cases, combining CBT with other therapies or medications may be recommended.

Overall, CBT empowers individuals to understand their thoughts, take control of their behavior, and build resilience through practical tools and reflection.
